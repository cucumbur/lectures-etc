# CS 196: Gamedev Hackerspace (FA16)
This was a "hackerspace" - a lab/lecture/wildcard discussion section - led by students Rick Sheahan ([@cucumbur](https://github.com/cucumbur)) and Victor Niu ([@Lathie](https://github.com/lathie)) for the class CS 196 (CS Freshman Honors) in FA16. You can find the original github repo [here](https://github.com/CS196Illinois/Game_Hackerspace).  
This was the first time the Gamedev Hackerspace had been done, so there were a lot of stumbling blocks and lessons to learn throughoughout the course of the semester.  
I am working on writing a post-morterm of the hackerspace and CS 196 in general that I think will be helpful to future iterations of the course - or future student-run classes in general.
