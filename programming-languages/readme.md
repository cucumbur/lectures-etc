This was a lecture I gave on 9/20/17 about choosing a programming language for a project.
The audience was Freshmen in CS at UIUC, for the course CS 196 Freshman Honors.
Some tradeoffs were made in talking about languages and their features - providing an intuitive explanation was more important than providing a formally correct definition.
